        <h1>"An Elevated Outdoor Experience" </h1>
        <h2>Our mission is to provide the premier multiday outdoor experience for adults over the age of 21 who are looking to escape the stresses of daily life and reconnect with the wilderness.</h2>
        <p>High Wilderness Adult Adventure Camp was founded in the California Bay Area in April of 2000 and has since grown to include excursion camps in Wyoming. We offer a wide variety of multi-day guided excursions in a wide variety of state and national parks. Two of our most popular camps venture into Yosemite and Yellowstone National Parks. Our trips provide our guests with the opportunity to decide which sport they would prefer when choosing their excursion and the option to decide the length of the trip. High Wilderness has the goal of creating an engaging and memorable experience that fosters deep interpersonal connections between their participants and with the natural world around us.<br>Welcome to our website!</p>
